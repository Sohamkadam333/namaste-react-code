<h2>What is `NPM`?</h2>
<p>NPM (Node Package Manager) is a widely-used package manager for Node.js, a popular runtime environment for executing
  JavaScript code outside of web browsers. NPM allows developers to easily discover, install, and manage open-source
  packages and libraries, both for front-end and back-end development. It comes bundled with Node.js and provides a
  command-line interface to interact with the NPM registry, where packages are stored and maintained. Developers can
  leverage NPM to efficiently share and reuse code, ensuring faster and more scalable development processes. NPM has
  become a crucial tool in the JavaScript ecosystem, fostering collaboration and accelerating software development.</p>

<h2>What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?</h2>
<p>Parcel and Webpack are popular build tools used in modern web development to bundle and optimize JavaScript, CSS, and
  other assets for production.

  They are needed because modern web applications often consist of numerous files that need to be delivered efficiently
  to
  end-users. These build tools enable developers to bundle all the necessary files into a smaller number of optimized
  files, reducing load times and improving website performance.

  Additionally, they offer features like code splitting, hot module replacement, and transpilation, making it easier for
  developers to use the latest JavaScript features and optimize their applications for different environments. These
  tools
  simplify the development process and enhance the overall user experience.</p>

<h2>- What is `.parcel-cache`?</h2>
<p>The `.parcel-cache` folder is a directory created by the Parcel bundler, a build tool for web applications. When
  Parcel
  processes and bundles files during development or production, it caches the intermediate results to improve build
  performance. The cache stores precompiled and optimized versions of assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images. It helps
  avoid redundant work by not recompiling unchanged files during subsequent builds. The cache directory is automatically
  generated by Parcel in the project's root folder, and it can be safely deleted if needed, as Parcel will regenerate it
  when running the next build or development server.</p>

<h2>What is `npx` ?</h2>
<p>`npx` is a command-line tool that comes with `npm` (Node Package Manager) and is used to run Node.js packages
  directly
  from the npm registry. It allows developers to execute package binaries without installing them globally, making it
  convenient for running one-time commands or trying out tools without the need for manual installations.</p>

<h2>What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?</h2>
<p>In the context of a Node.js project's `package.json` file, `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are two distinct
  categories for specifying required packages.

  1. `dependencies`: These are packages necessary for the application to run in a production environment. They include
  the
  core dependencies of the application.

  2. `devDependencies`: These are packages needed during development and are not required for the actual production
  deployment. They typically include tools, testing libraries, or build utilities used during the development process.
</p>


<h2>What is Tree Shaking?</h2>
<p>Tree shaking is a technique used in modern JavaScript build processes to eliminate unused code from the final bundle.
  It
  relies on the static nature of ES6 modules to analyze the code and identify which parts are not being used. During the
  bundling process, the tree shaking algorithm removes these unused parts, reducing the overall bundle size. This
  optimization is crucial for optimizing web application performance, as it ensures that only the necessary code is
  delivered to users, leading to faster load times and improved efficiency, especially when dealing with large codebases
  and third-party libraries.</p>


<h2>What is Hot Module Replacement?</h2>
<p>Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in modern JavaScript bundlers like Webpack and Parcel. It allows developers
  to
  update code changes in the application without a full page refresh during development. When a code change is made, HMR
  injects only the updated module into the running application, preserving its state. This significantly speeds up the
  development process by providing real-time updates and maintaining the application's state, resulting in a smoother
  and
  more efficient development experience.</p>


<h2>- List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.</h2>
<p>Parcel boasts several powerful features that make it a popular build tool for web applications:

  1. **Zero Configuration**: Parcel requires little to no configuration, reducing setup time and complexity.

  2. **Built-in Asset Support**: It natively supports a wide range of asset types, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML,
  images, fonts, and more, without the need for additional plugins.

  3. **Blazing Fast Bundling**: Parcel uses multicore processing and dependency graph analysis to achieve fast and
  efficient bundling of assets.

  4. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: During development, HMR allows for real-time updates without a full page refresh,
  resulting in a seamless development experience.

  5. **Code Splitting**: Parcel automatically performs code splitting, breaking the bundle into smaller chunks, which
  helps reduce initial load times.

  6. **Support for Various Languages**: Parcel supports not only JavaScript but also other languages like TypeScript,
  Sass, Less, and many more.

  7. **Efficient Caching**: It utilizes caching to speed up subsequent builds and improve overall build performance.

  8. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Parcel optimizes the output for different browsers to ensure consistent behavior
  across various environments.

  9. **Friendly Error Messages**: It provides clear and informative error messages, making it easier for developers to
  identify and fix issues.

  10. **Easy Integration with npm Packages**: Parcel can easily integrate with npm packages and other third-party
  libraries, simplifying the use of external dependencies in projects.

  11. **Automatic Polyfilling**: Parcel automatically includes necessary polyfills for older browsers, ensuring better
  compatibility.

  12. **Scoped CSS**: Parcel supports CSS Modules and automatically scopes CSS class names, avoiding global namespace
  collisions.

  These features make Parcel a powerful and user-friendly tool for building modern web applications efficiently and
  effectively.</p>


<h2>What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?</h2>
<p>`.gitignore` is a text file used in version control systems like Git to specify files and directories that should be
  ignored and not tracked by the version control system. It helps prevent irrelevant or sensitive files from being
  committed to the repository. Developers should add files like build artifacts, logs, and dependencies to `.gitignore`,
  while important code files and configuration files should not be ignored.</p>


<h2>What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`</h2>
<p>`package.json` is a configuration file that lists project metadata and dependencies, while `package-lock.json` is an
  automatically generated file that provides detailed information about the exact versions of dependencies installed.
  `package-lock.json` ensures consistent dependency installations across different environments, ensuring reproducible
  builds.</p>

<h2>Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?</h2>
<p>You should not modify `package-lock.json` manually because it is automatically generated by the package manager and
  contains specific dependency versions that ensure consistent and reproducible installations. Modifying it directly can
  lead to dependency conflicts and unexpected behavior in your project.</p>


<h2>What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?</h2>
<p>`node_modules` is a directory that contains all the dependencies installed for a Node.js project. It is not a good
  idea
  to push `node_modules` to git as it can bloat the repository and cause unnecessary duplication. It's better to add
  `node_modules` to the `.gitignore` file and let others install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.</p>


<h2>What is the `dist` folder?</h2>
<p>The `dist` (distribution) folder is a directory in a project that stores the final output files after the build
  process.
  It typically contains minified and optimized code, assets, and other resources ready for deployment to a production
  server. The `dist` folder is often used to distribute the application to end-users.</p>

<h2>What is `browserlists`?</h2>
<p>
  `browserslist` is a configuration file used in web development to specify the list of browsers and their versions that
  a project should support. Tools like Autoprefixer and Babel use this file to apply appropriate polyfills and
  transpilations, ensuring compatibility with targeted browsers based on their usage statistics.
